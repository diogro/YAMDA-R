\section*{Introduction}

Phenotypes are the result of many overlaping genetic effects and developmental
processes \citep{Lande1983-ez,Klingenberg2008-ll,Melo2016-yw}. These different
factors create a structured pattern of phenotypic correlations, which we can
measure and use to infer something about the underlying processes. Identifing
modules, groups of traits that are more related among themselves than with other
traits, is a powerful way to describe and interpret the patterns of pheotypic
covariation.

Brief review of existing methods:

\begin{itemize}
    \item CR    
    \item EMMLi
    \item Mint
    \item Mantel
\end{itemize}

Most methods of comparing different modularity hypothesis don't allow for the
comparison of nested hypothesis. 

Most are ad-hock measures similarity, and do
not allow for the use of proper statistical methods. 

The likelihood in EMMLi is
extrapolated from the expectation on measuring the correlation between two
traits, and does not acctually use the data in the likelihood computation, only
the correlations. 

Yamda sets it self appart by using the likelihood of the data to compare the
different modularity hypothesis, allowing for overlaping modules, allowing
different methods for the construction of the putative covariance matrix, and
having

\section*{Discussion}

The interaction between selection and multivariate covariation is a
central part of our understanding of evolution. Even simple selection
regimes can produce complex multivariate responses due to cascading
developmental effects and genetic constraints. Here, ...
