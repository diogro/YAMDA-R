\section*{Introduction}

Phenotypes are the result of many overlaping genetic effects and developmental processes \citep{Lande1983-ez,Klingenberg2008-ll,Melo2016-yw}. These different 
factors create a structured pattern of phenotypic correlations, which we can measure and use to infer
something about the underlying processes. Identifing modules, groups of traits that are more related
among themselves than with other traits, is a powerful way to describe and interpret the patterns of 
pheotypic covariation.

\section*{Discussion}

The interaction between selection and multivariate covariation is a
central part of our understanding of evolution. Even simple selection
regimes can produce complex multivariate responses due to cascading
developmental effects and genetic constraints. Here, ...
